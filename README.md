# Untangular
Untangular is a native iOS utility built to visualize and resolve complex relational data. Unlike standard apps that rely on basic UI components, Untangular utilizes Core Graphics (Quartz 2D) to render dynamic, interactive environments where users can physically "untangle" nodes and connections in real-time.
